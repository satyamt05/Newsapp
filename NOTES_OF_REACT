LIFE CYCLE  theory
• The series of events that happen from the mounting of a React component to its

                  •Mounting - Birth of your component
                     Update - Growth of your component
                   •Unmount - Death of your component

Methods in React Component Lifecycle
   ->    The render() method is used to render HTML of the component in react. This
        method is required for a class based component to render the DOM. It runs
        during the mounting and updating of your component. Render() method should
        be pure ie you cannot modify state inside it!

  ->    The componentDid Update() method runs after the component output has
        been rendered to the DOM.

   ->  The componentDidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating
      happens. The most common use case for the componentDidUpdate() method
      is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

   ->  The componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method is called just before the
      component is unmounted and destroyed. Usually used to perform cleanups
